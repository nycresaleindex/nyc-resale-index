<h1>New York City Resale Index</h1>

<p>
The New York City Resale Index is a working reference for selling designer and vintage clothing in New York City.
It documents store policies, expectations, and common points of friction, with the goal of helping sellers make
informed decisions before walking into a shop or submitting items.
</p>

<p>
This index is updated on a rolling basis. It is not affiliated with any resale store.

<h2 id="stores">Store policies</h2>

<p>
This section documents resale policies and practices across New York City, including
what stores typically accept, how payouts are structured, appointment requirements,
and other factors that affect the selling process.
</p>

<p>
Entries are written to reflect patterns and stated policies, not individual outcomes.
</p>

<h2 id="direct">Sell directly to NYC Resale Index</h2>

<p>
Sellers may submit photos for direct evaluation by NYC Resale Index.
This option is intended for sellers who prefer a single point of contact rather than navigating multiple stores.
</p>

<p>
Details on how to submit will be added here.
</p>

<h2 id="about">About this project</h2>

<p>
NYC Resale Index exists to reduce uncertainty and wasted time for sellers.
The resale landscape in New York City is fragmented and often opaque.
This project aims to document what is usually learned informally.
